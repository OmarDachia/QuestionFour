#4 Write a Promgram to print area of circle, rectangle & square.

1. The area of a circle can be calculated using the formula:

Area=π×radius^2

Where:

π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.

So, to calculate the area of a circle, you need to know the radius.

2. The area of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:

Area=length×width

Where:

    Length: The distance between the two longest sides of the rectangle.
    Width: The distance between the two shortest sides of the rectangle.

3. The area of a square can be calculated using the formula:

Area=side^2

but side could longest or shortest like in rectangle

Where:

    Side: The length of any side of the square.
